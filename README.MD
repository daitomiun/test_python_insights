# Pokemon battle insights

> Due to not finding a suitable API thaks to request limiting in many products api's I used the pokeApi to get a battle insight 

# Code explanation
I parse the csv and fetched the pokeAPI to get battle insight in my code and generate a report

# issues or limitations
here it will accept the CSV used in my_pokemons.csv file
also the random pokemons extend from the 20 pokemons given inside the script

1. Read and process the CSV data

After cloning the repo, enter to the src directory:
```bash
cd src
```

Run the command
```bash
python3 src/analysis.py data/my_pokemons.csv
```

then in your local machine you will get a report of the battle insight like the one shown in the report in the github repo!
2. Choose and integrate ONE external data source
 - Could be pricing data, market trends, economic indicators, etc.
 - Document why you chose this source

> I chose the pokeAPI thanks to the ease of use and rich information about pokemon for my battle insights

3. Create ONE useful insight
 - Examples: price comparison, trend alert, recommendation system
 - The specific insight is up to you - be creative!

> In this case I made a battle insights comparasion to random pokemon from the poke API
> In this case it's related to attack, health and weight of the pokemon

4. Push your work to a Github repository (make sure itâ€™s public!) and submit your
link

Right here!
