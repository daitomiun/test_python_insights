# Pokemon battle insights

> Due to not finding a suitable API thaks to request limiting in many products api's I used the pokeApi to get a battle insight 



1. Read and process the CSV data

Run the command
```shell
python3 analysis.py ../data/my_pokemons.csv 
```

then in your local machine you should get a report of the battle insight like the one shown in the report in the github repo!


2. Choose and integrate ONE external data source
 - Could be pricing data, market trends, economic indicators, etc.
 - Document why you chose this source

> I chose the pokeAPI thanks to the ease of use and rich information about pokemon for my battle insights

3. Create ONE useful insight
 - Examples: price comparison, trend alert, recommendation system
 - The specific insight is up to you - be creative!

> In this case I made a battle insights comparasion to random pokemon from the poke API
> In this case it's related to attack, health and weight of the pokemon

4. Push your work to a Github repository (make sure itâ€™s public!) and submit your
link

Right here!
